# MERN-SDP
MERN Stack Skill Development Project
## Event Management System
Technologies incorporated in this project: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node-js)
#### MongoDB: Database (Storage) 
#### Express: framework for Node.js 
#### React: Front-End (User Interface)
#### Node-js: Backend Connectivity (handling server-side logic)

As a part of the skill development projects, we have been assigned to a management system, which is the Event Management System. For generating this project we have approached multiple aspects and gathered the appropriate information. This includes field surveys, interactions with Event managers, prototypes, and many other things.

To view our project there are some important things to do, you have to install node_modules by using "npm install node_modules" in both evm and server then after that you have to start the frontend(evm) with "npm start" command in the terminal and then you have to change mongoDBurl in the server-side code with your own URL and start the server with "node app.js" (as what you mention in the package.json).
